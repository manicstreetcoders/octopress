[Legends of the Fail](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/opinion/legends-of-the-fail.html?_r=1&scp=19&sq=paul%20krugman&st=cse) 에서

유로의 탄생은 이데올로기 양편을 가로지르는 아이디어였다고 이야기함.

> First things first: The attempt to create a common European currency was one of those ideas that cut across the usual ideological lines. It was cheered on by American right-wingers, who saw it as the next best thing to a revived gold standard, and by Britain’s left, which saw it as a big step toward a social-democratic Europe. 

<br />
미국 우파 + 영국 좌파 | 영국 보수파 + 미국 리버럴 로 쪼개버렸기 때문에,
기존 대립각을 골때리게 관통.

> But it was opposed by British conservatives, who also saw it as a step toward a social-democratic Europe. And it was questioned by American liberals, who worried — rightly, I’d say (but then I would, wouldn’t I?) — about what would happen if countries couldn’t use monetary and fiscal policy to fight recessions.

<br />
유로 사태를 정치적으로 이용하려는 세력들이 준동. 복지를 깐다던가. 정부의 재정정책을 깐다던가.

> The euro crisis, then, says nothing about the sustainability of the welfare state. But does it make the case for belt-tightening in a depressed economy?

<br />
과분한 복지와는 아무런 상관이 없다고 이야기함.

> Oh, and Canada, which has universal health care and much more generous aid to the poor than the United States, has weathered the crisis better than we have.

<br />
자국의 통화로 돈을 빌릴 수 있느냐 없느냐가 핵심. 일본은 계속 국채 발행하고 저금리로 국채에 대한 이자 부담을 최소화하고 있음.

> First, if you look around the world you see that the big determining factor for interest rates isn’t the level of government debt but whether a government borrows in its own currency. Japan is much more deeply in debt than Italy, but the interest rate on long-term Japanese bonds is only about 1 percent to Italy’s 7 percent. Britain’s fiscal prospects look worse than Spain’s, but Britain can borrow at just a bit over 2 percent, while Spain is paying almost 6 percent.

<br />
스페인, 이탈리아는 자국 통화 표시 국채발행으로 자금 조달이 안되는 제3세계 국가의 처지로 전락. 국가 단위에서 유로 돈 찍어낼 권한도 없음. 

> What has happened, it turns out, is that by going on the euro, Spain and Italy in effect reduced themselves to the status of third-world countries that have to borrow in someone else’s currency, with all the loss of flexibility that implies. In particular, since euro-area countries can’t print money even in an emergency, they’re subject to funding disruptions in a way that nations that kept their own currencies aren’t — and the result is what you see right now. America, which borrows in dollars, doesn’t have that problem.
